  <h1>Design Decisions</h1>
  <p>Our main theme for the homepage is "Bad Boy Bradshaw." Our color scheme was 
    inspired by Dr. B's clothing the day we recieved the assignment.
    He was wearing a dark blue btton-down shirt, which we used for our background color. 
    For the khaki pants, we used khaki for the header background and many of the texts.
    To represent the brown belt, we used peru as the prep box background.
    And for the brown shoes, which were a little darker, we used saddlebrown as the current and
    past box backgrounds. We also added an image of glasses next to the date in each day box because Dr. B 
    wears glasses. As for the layout, we went for a simple and functional one.
